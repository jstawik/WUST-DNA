	 			\item e.g. something like ``In the basic variant $A$ of the averaging algorithms, the estimator's probabilistic error grows as $t \to \infty$''.
	 				  and ``In the strategy implemented in the variant $B$, the estimator's probabilistic error depends on the parameter $R$ and for constant $R$ tends
	 				  to $0$ in expectation as the numbers of counters $L$ grows.''

 		\begin{itemize}
 			\item summary of the obtained experimental and theoretical results

\section*{Considered scenarios}
The network will be modeled by a simple, connected and undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V| = n$ vertices representing the stations and $|E| = m$ edges corresponding to
bidirectional links between nodes. Two stations $u, v \in V$ can communicate directly if and only if $\{u,v\} \in E$...

Assumptions on the considered theoretical model: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{We'll discuss the details during the next call}
	\item each station observes a stream of data $(s^{(v)}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ arriving in consecutive time instants $t = 0, 1, \dotsc$-- like in \cite{Nugroho:2020:AveragingTS}
	\item our goal is to calculate the estimations $(avg_t)_{t\geq 0}$ in a fully distributed manner, where
		\[
			avg_t \stackrel{\text{df}}{=} \frac {\sum_{v \in V} s^{(v)}_t}{n}
		\]
	\item we will consider certain modifications of the method proposed in \cite{Nugroho:2020:AveragingTS}, which extends the approach based on approximate histograms
		introduced in \cite{JCi:2018:Histograms}.
	\item communication model -- like in \cite{JCi:2018:Histograms} (different model than in \cite{Nugroho:2020:AveragingTS}), i.e. broadcast-based communication instead of gossip-based
		(\textbf{this is only my suggestion -- you can choose what you prefer)}
	\item measures of precision -- I suggest implementing and calculating both measures of precision, i.e. $\text{err}(\text{wm}(\vec{C}_L,\text{wm}\vec{H})$ introduced in \cite{JCi:2018:Histograms}
		and $\eta$ from \cite{Nugroho:2020:AveragingTS}. We'll see what we'll get. In the thesis we can e.g. briefly mention, that the precision can be defined in different ways, 
		depending on the specific applications, considered scenarios etc.
	\item considered strategies (some modification of the approach of counting ``leavers'' and ``joiners'' for each interval):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item variant $0$ -- for each $t$ we independently run the \textsc{HistMean} algorithm with fixed $L$ and $K$
			\item variant $1$ -- the strategy from \cite{Nugroho:2020:AveragingTS} -- probabilistic counters for ``leavers'' $C^{leave}_{L,i}$ and ``joiners'' $C^{join}_{L,i}$
				for each interval $I_i$, $i \in \{1, \dotsc, K\}$  (the number of leavers and joiners will grow as
				$t \to \infty$ $\Rightarrow$ I suppose that the error related to probabilistic counters will also grow and the precision will be lost for large $t$,
				but this is only a conjecture and this may not be the case -- we should investigate this)\\
				Q: In \cite{Nugroho:2020:AveragingTS} there was a flag $r_{flag}$, which affects the exchange of messages -- should we embed this mechanism in the
				broadcast-based communication or not? We'll discuss it during the next call.
			\item variant $2$ -- ``reset'' the counters every $R^{\text{th}}$ round (e.g. $joiners \gets \max\{joiners - leavers,0\}$, $leavers \gets 0$)
			\item variant $3$ -- every $R^{\text{th}}$ round ``reset'' the counters by running the \textsc{HistMean} algorithm from scratch
		\end{itemize}
	\item in each case we will calculate the estimator's precision (as a function of the time $t$) for different network sizes $n$ (e.g. $n = 10,\,100,\,1000,\,5000$)
	\item distribution of the input data
		\begin{itemize}
			\item in the basic scenarios we assume that the data are independent (at least there is no spatial dependence)
			\item uniform distribution over some interval $[m, M]$ (e.g. over the unit interval)
			\item data for which the stations ``will change intervals'' rarely
			\item data for which the changes of intervals will be very frequent
		\end{itemize}
	\item for some scenarios and network topologies calculate the message complexity (the number of exchanged messages)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item data are generated with different intensities, some stations update their values more frequently than the others
	\item data streams are not time-homogeneous -- the distribution of the data $(s^{(v)}_t)_{t \geq 0}$ for a given station $v$ may vary in time
	\item spatial and temporal dependencies of data
	\item communication errors -- broken links, nodes failures
\end{itemize}
